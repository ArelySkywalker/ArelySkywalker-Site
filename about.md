## Hola!

I am a Web Developer for Powderkeg based in Madison, Wisconsin. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computational Mathematics with Computer Science at the University of New Mexico. Tech and Sofware has always been my passion. I built this site to post coding challenges that I have solutions to - these are very useful to help you prepare for developer interviews, whether you want to be a Web Developer or Software Engineer. Reach out to me if you have any questions or a fun challenge for me. Enjoy!

If I'm not coding, you could find me at home on my Xbox and having a brewskie. Current Games I am playing right now:
*   Call of Duty: Black Ops 4
*   Monster Prom
*   Broforce
*   Left 4 Dead 2
*   Cuphead

Other hobby of mine is drawing. I LOVE to draw, and I pretty much use every medium. The types of medium I do are:
*   Chalk/Pastel
*   Acryllic Paints
*   Pencil/Pen/Markers
*   Digital (iPad Pro 12.9" + Apple Pencil + Procreate)
*   Ink

You can definitely check out some of my art on the Instagram page.
